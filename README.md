### Description 

All software included in this depository is built to run in GUI formatting. 

### Worth checking

All the programs are worth checking out, but two I am most proud of. They are: scientific calculator and hangman. The former is a program consisting of 360 lines of code (including comments), which makes it the most extensive program in this depository. Honorable mention goes to hangman. It is in a way a continuation of hangman from my earlier project of the same name. I had to take the earlier program apart and put it together, so that this time it's possible to play it with the help of GUI.

- [Hangman](https://github.com/8uziak/Projects-Python-GUI-only/tree/main/Hangman) (for the program to work properly, you need to download the text file "words.txt" and place it in the same folder as the python file itself.)
